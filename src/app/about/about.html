  <h4 class="col col-xs-12 text-orange"><b>What is BuddyTrakr?</b></h4>
  <p class="col col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 font-size-14">
    Do you have a ton of stuffed animals in your collection? Then BuddyTrakr is for you! This site allows you to keep
    track of all of your stuffed animals (your Buddies!) so you don't forget their names or how long they've spent time
    with you in bed, on vacation, or just lounging about. It lets you add buddies, check them out from wherever all of them
    call home, and then return them to be with the rest of the group when they've been out long enough. With built in searching
    you can make sure that all of your buddies get a chance to be out, or just keep track of how many times you've had out your
    favorite two/three/twenty-five!

  <h4 class="col col-xs-12 text-orange"><b>Why a Stuffed Animal Tracking App?</b></h4>
  <p class="col col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 font-size-14">This came about as almost kind of a joke. My wife and I ended up collecting a ton of stuffed animals as a way
    to track where we've been on vacation or just as little gifts to each other. We tried to keep track of all of them
    since we had given them all names and backstories (a childish pursuit I know, but still fun for us) but nothing
    seemed to work. Sometimes we'd end up having a couple chilling out on the couch with us and wanted to get a sort of rotation going
    so that there was an even balance among all of them. This led to us first talking about just using clunky spreadsheets. Then I said,
    "I need to pick up Angular2, why don't I just learn that by building a tracking app?". After a couple of set-backs, we finally got to
    work on it. I provided all of the necessary coding any she provided all the assets.
