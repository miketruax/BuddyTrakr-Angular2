# **BuddyTrakr Angular 2 MEAN App v 1.0**


# **What is BuddyTrakr?**
  
  Do you have a ton of stuffed animals in your collection? Then BuddyTrakr is for you! This site allows you to keep
  track of all of your stuffed animals (your Buddies!) so you don't forget their names or how long they've spent time
  with you in bed, on vacation, or just lounging about. It lets you add buddies, check them out from wherever all of them
  call home, and then return them to be with the rest of the group when they've been out long enough. With built in searching
  you can make sure that all of your buddies get a chance to be out, or just keep track of how many times you've had out your
  favorite two/three/twenty-five!``


# **Why a Stuffed Animal Tracking App?**
This came about as almost kind of a joke. My wife and I ended up collecting a ton of stuffed animals as a way
  to track where we've been on vacation or just as little gifts to each other. We tried to keep track of all of them
  since we had given them all names and backstories (a childish pursuit I know, but still fun for us) but nothing
  seemed to work. Sometimes we'd end up having a couple chilling out on the couch with us and wanted to get a sort of rotation going
  so that there was an even balance among all of them. This led to us first talking about just using clunky spreadsheets. Then I said,
  "I need to pick up Angular2, why don't I just learn that by building a tracking app?". After a couple of set-backs, we finally got to
  work on it. I provided all of the necessary coding any she provided all the assets.

### Current Functions
- User (with username/password login) based tracking of Buddies
- Checking in/out of Buddies
- Buddy Birthday based off date added
- Searchable list of buddies
- Auto-populating number of times out/ days out
- Editing of most fields for each buddy
- Ability to change password after set-up

### Future Plans
 
  - Deletion for buddies (heaven-forbid)
  - E-mail validation before signing in for the first time
  - Reset password link (currently if you forget your password you can't recover your account)
  - Friends list with other users. Would potentially allow borrowing buddies or seeing who they have checked out
  - More search abilities and/or more data fields for each buddy.
  - Easy search for scientific name based off species field
  - Link to Wikipedia through Scientific Name if field is populated
  
### Current Tech
  
  - Angluar 2 w/ Angular CLI for ease of scaffolding
  - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for ease of styling
  - SCSS for custom styling
  - Rxjs and ngrx for Observables and Stores for client-side
  - Node.js in ES6
  - Utilized some components via [@datatype_void](https://github.com/datatypevoid/vulgar)'s MEA2N constructor while learning Angular 2 
  - MongoDB via [mLab](https://www.mlab.com) for off-site MongoDB storage
